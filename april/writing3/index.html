		I’ve been doing line drawing everyday since last week and it  feels good to go back to physical materials and more analog method. All I do is still life.

		<p id="part3">
		I started doing art with still life drawings. I hated it for a long time after every art project I did in high school was drawing and painting. I was tired of it, and after a long time not touching it, I found it actually very relaxing and fun.

		This pandemic has taught me to observe and appreciate the little things around me. Doing these drawings helps me study the form and composition of my surroundings. It also help ground myself under the circumstance.
